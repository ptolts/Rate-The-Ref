I wrote this web app right after graduating University. The code is just awful, but it worked autonomously. 

In the "fetch" directory are demons I wrote to monitor the nhl site for games, and then spawn game trackers. Seems overkill today, but it ran flawlessly for over a year.

Seems the php is located in /application/views/pages. I haven't worked with PHP since this, and I don't think I'll start.
